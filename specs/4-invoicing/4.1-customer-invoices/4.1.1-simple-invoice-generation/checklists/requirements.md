# Specification Quality Checklist: SPEC-4.1.1 Generación de Facturas Simples

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details leaking into business requirements
- [x] Focused on billing flow, payment recording, and sequence numbering
- [x] Written for both technical and non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed according to spec-guidelines.md

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable and verifiable
- [x] Auto-generation from confirmed sales clearly mapped
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined with BDD (Given-When-Then)
- [x] Edge cases are identified (payment state transitions, duplicate prevention)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (Included vs Out of Scope)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (auto-creation, payment marking, navigation)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Objective & Scope
- [x] Specification ready for planning and task breakdown

## Notes

- All validation checks passed. Ready for `/speckit-plan`.
